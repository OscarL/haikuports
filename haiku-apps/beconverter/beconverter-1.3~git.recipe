SUMMARY="A unit of measure conversion utility for BeOS/Haiku/Zeta"
DESCRIPTION="BeConverter is a BeOS native, multi-threaded unit of measure conversion \
tool. It features high-speed, "live" cross-unit conversions using a custom \
built conversion engine. BeConverter will come in handy for American \
citizens since USA is the only country not to follow the metric system. \
For e.g: the US follows farenheit instead of celcius as a measure of \
temperature and miles instead of kilometers etc. \

BeConverter is a freeware program and can be used, copied and \
distributed freely but only in accord to the license agreement. A \
similar app for Windows is being sold for $25 (USD) :-( So the least \
you could do is write to me about BeConverter and copy it totally \
in accord to the License. \

BeConverter is completely extensible and flexible. It uses features of \
the BeOS File System (BFS) to its advantage for speed and ease of \
handling, the main reason why the BFS approach was chosen was not \
only will it bring in complete customizability but because I was lazy to \
write a new window for editing and adding units, checking for validity \
etc. :^)\
